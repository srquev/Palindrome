# intro
This resonsive web page contains an input field and a button.
# working
once a user input a string/number it will be converted into reverse string/number using for loop.
Then after entered string/number will be matched to reversed string/number. 
If it matches then the entered string/number is palindrome,
and will show the output dynamically in a <p> tag along with entered string.
# alternative approach
store string/number in a variable,convert it into a array using split(''); method, then reverse the converted array by reverse(); method,
once you reversed the array then again convert it into string using join(); method.
compare it to usre's input and show the ouput.
  
  Thank You!
